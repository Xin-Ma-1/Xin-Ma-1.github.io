#### About

I received my BS in Statistics from Peking University and my PhD in Biostatistics from Emory University. My dissertation was advised by [Suprateek Kundu](https://sites.google.com/view/suprateek/home), and focused on developing prediction and feature selection methods for complex, high-dimensional data with applications to neuroimaging. I joined Columbia as an assistant professor in 2023.

My current research interests include statistical and deep learning approaches for high-dimensional and complex structured data, with special application interests in medical imaging. I am affiliated with the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center [Cancer Biostatistics Shared Resource](https://www.cancer.columbia.edu/research/shared-resources/cancer-biostatistics) and an active member of the Functional Data Analysis Working Group ([FDAWG](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/programs/functional-data-analysis-working-group)). You can email me to join our FDAWG mailing list to keep up-to-date with our events.

I welcome students for collaboration on various research projects. Please email me with a brief self-introduction and state your research interests.
