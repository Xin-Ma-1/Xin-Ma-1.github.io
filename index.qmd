#### About

I received my BS in Statistics from Peking University and my PhD in Biostatistics from Emory University. My dissertation was advised by [Suprateek Kundu](https://sites.google.com/view/suprateek/home), and focused on developing prediction and feature selection methods for complex, high-dimensional data with applications to neuroimaging. I joined Columbia as an assistant professor in 2023.

My current research interests include statistical learning for high-dimensional data, functional data analysis, measurement error modeling, deep learning methods, imaging data, and cancer-related analysis. Student who is interested in working with me should email me with a brief self-introduction.
